# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Documenting the Crawl4AI RAG MCP Server project.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the `docs` directory and `docs/adr` directory.
*   Created the `docs/adr/template.md` file.
*   Created the `docs/memory-bank` directory.
*   Created the `docs/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` file.
*   Created the `docs/memory-bank/productContext.md` file.

## Next Steps

*   Create the remaining Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Populate the Memory Bank files with relevant information based on my understanding of the project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   How to best structure the Memory Bank files to capture the key aspects of the project.
*   What level of detail to include in each file.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Follow the Memory Bank structure defined in the `.clinerules` file.
*   Maintain clear and concise documentation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project uses Crawl4AI for web crawling and Supabase for storing crawled content and performing vector similarity search.
*   The server provides tools for crawling websites and performing RAG queries.
*   The project uses OpenAI's API for creating embeddings.
